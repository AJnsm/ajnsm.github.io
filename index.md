		 	<h2> Hello World <br> </h2>
			I am a scientist at the <a href="https://www.d-iep.org" target="_blank">Dutch Institute for Emergent Phenomena</a>, working at the Institute of Physics (IoP), and of the Institute of Logic, Language, and Computation (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam.<br>
			<br>
			I combine intuition from physics, knowledge from biology, and techniques from mathematics, to think about higher-order interactions and emergence in complex and living systems. Find my latest publications <a href="/publications">here</a>.

		</p>

			I sometimes get distracted by completely unrelated projects. A few of those are listed <a href="/projects">here</a>.
