In a [recent paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.7.023016), I proposed to study complex systems through a mereological lens by applying the Möbius inversion theorem. I also covered this in [a recent blogpost]({% post_url 2025-01-28-mereoPhysics %}). Here, I will collect some of the most important applications of Möbius transformations in the sciences. I will update this table as I find more applications. If you have suggestions, please send me an email, or leave a comment below!
